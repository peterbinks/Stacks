Wordpress theme for libraries, based off of the [underscores](http://http://underscores.me/) starter theme, and including [Foundation](foundation.zurb.com) as a base for things like accordians, tab-groups, etc. 

This theme depends on several plugins to make it work. A custome post type plugin [new-items](http://github.com/peterbinks), used to create the new items, books, movies, albums, on the site. [The Events Calendar](https://theeventscalendar.com/) to manage all of the library events/programs. [Advanced Custom Fields](http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/), [Revolution Slider](http://revolution.themepunch.com/), and [Gravity Forms] (http://www.gravityforms.com/).
